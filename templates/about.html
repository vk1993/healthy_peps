    <p style = "padding-left:50px;padding-left: 50px; font-size: x-large;padding-bottom:50px;padding-top:50px;color:black;font-family: Copperplate, Papyrus, fantasy">If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.

        With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.
        
        Prediabetes means that your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.
        
        </p> 
    <h1 style = "padding-left:50px;font-size:xx-large;color:black;font-family: Copperplate, Papyrus, fantasy" >2.How do the foods I eat affect my blood sugar levels?</h1> 
    <p style = "padding-left:50px;padding-left: 50px; font-size: x-large;padding-bottom:50px;padding-top:50px;color:black;font-family: Copperplate, Papyrus, fantasy">The sugar in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates, or "carbs." Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood sugar level will be.

        Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood sugar at a healthy level. When you control your blood sugar, you lower your chance of having serious health problems from diabetes, such as vision loss and heart problems.
        
        And if you have prediabetes or are at risk for diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood sugar levels healthy may help prevent type 2 diabetes later on.</p>

    <p style = "padding-left:50px;padding-left: 50px;padding-left: 50px; font-size: x-large;padding-bottom:50px;padding-top:50px;color:black;font-family: Copperplate, Papyrus, fantasy">1. Fatty fish
        <br>
        <br>
        Salmon, sardines, herring, anchovies, and mackerel are great sources of the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA, which have major benefits for heart health (1Trusted Source).
        
        Getting enough of these fats on a regular basis is especially important for people with diabetes, who have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.
        
        DHA and EPA protect the cells that line your blood vessels, reduce markers of inflammation, and may help improve the way your arteries function.
        
        Research indicates that people who eat fatty fish regularly have a lower risk of acute coronary syndromes, like heart attacks, and are less likely to die from heart disease (2).
        
        Studies show that eating fatty fish may also help regulate blood sugar.
        
        A study involving 68 adults who had overweight or obesity found that participants who consumed fatty fish had significant improvements in post-meal blood sugar levels than participants who consumed lean fish (3Trusted Source).
        
        Fish is also a great source of high quality protein, which helps you feel full and helps stabilize blood sugar levels.
        <br>
        <br>
        SUMMARY<br>
        Fatty fish contain omega-3 fats that can help reduce inflammation and other risk factors of heart disease and stroke. Plus, it’s a great source of protein, which is important for managing blood sugar.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Leafy greens
        <br>
        <br>
        Leafy green vegetables are extremely nutritious and low in calories.
        
        They’re also very low in digestible carbs, or carbs absorbed by the body, so they won’t significantly affect blood sugar levels.
        
        Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are good sources of many vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C.
        
        Some evidence suggests that people with diabetes have lower vitamin C levels than people without diabetes, and they may have greater vitamin C requirements (4Trusted Source).
        
        Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant and also has anti-inflammatory qualities.
        
        Increasing dietary intake of vitamin C-rich foods can help people with diabetes increase their serum vitamin C levels while reducing inflammation and cellular damage (5Trusted Source).
        <br>
        <br>
        SUMMARY<br>
        Leafy green vegetables are rich in nutrients like vitamin C as well as antioxidants that protect your heart and eye health.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Avocados
        <br>
        <br>
        Avocados have less than 1 gram of sugar, few carbohydrates, a high fiber content, and healthy fats, so you don’t have to worry about them raising your blood sugar levels.
        
        Avocado consumption is also associated with improved overall diet quality and significantly lower body weight and body mass index (BMI) (6Trusted Source).
        
        This makes avocados an ideal snack for people with diabetes, especially since obesity increases the chances of developing diabetes.
        
        Avocados may have properties specific to preventing diabetes.
        
        A 2019 study in mice found that avocatin B (AvoB), a fat molecule found only in avocados, inhibits incomplete oxidation in skeletal muscle and the pancreas, which reduces insulin resistance (7Trusted Source).
        
        More research is needed in humans to establish the connection between avocados and diabetes prevention.
        <br>
        <br>
        SUMMARY<br>
        Avocados have less than 1 gram of sugar and are associated with improved overall diet quality. Avocados may also have properties specific to diabetes prevention.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Eggs
        <br>
        <br>
        Regular egg consumption may reduce your heart disease risk in several ways.
        
        Eggs may decrease inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, increase your HDL (good) cholesterol levels, and modify the size and shape of your LDL (bad) cholesterol.
        
        A 2019 study found that eating a high fat, low carb breakfast of eggs could help people with diabetes manage blood sugar levels throughout the day (8Trusted Source).
        
        Older research has linked egg consumption with heart disease in people with diabetes.
        
        But a more recent review of controlled studies found that eating 6 to 12 eggs per week as part of a nutritious diet did not increase heart disease risk factors in people with diabetes (9Trusted Source).
        
        What’s more, some research suggests that eating eggs may reduce the risk of stroke (10Trusted Source).
        <br>
        <br>
        SUMMARY<br>
        Eggs may improve risk factors for heart disease, promote good blood sugar management, protect eye health, and keep you feeling full.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Chia seeds
        <br>
        <br>
        Chia seeds are a wonderful food for people with diabetes.
        
        They’re extremely high in fiber, yet low in digestible carbs.
        
        In fact, 11 of the 12 grams of carbs in a 28-gram (1-ounce) serving of chia seeds are fiber, which doesn’t raise blood sugar.
        
        The viscous fiber in chia seeds can actually lower your blood sugar levels by slowing down the rate at which food moves through your gut and is absorbed.
        
        Chia seeds may help you achieve a moderate weight because fiber reduces hunger and makes you feel full. Chia seeds may also help maintain glycemic management in people with diabetes.
        
        A study involving 77 adults with overweight or obesity and a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes found that eating chia seeds supports weight loss and helps maintain good glycemic control (11Trusted Source).
        
        Additionally, chia seeds have been shown to help reduce blood pressure and inflammatory markers.
        <br>
        <br>
        SUMMARY<br>
        Chia seeds contain high amounts of fiber, which may help you lose weight. They also help maintain blood glucose levels.
        <br>
        <br>
        6. Beans
        <br>
        <br>
        Beans are affordable, nutritious, and super healthy.
        
        Beans are a type of legume rich in B vitamins, beneficial minerals (calcium, potassium, and magnesium), and fiber.
        
        They also have a very low glycemic index, which is important for managing diabetes.
        
        Beans may also help prevent diabetes.
        
        In a study involving more than 3,000 participants at high risk of cardiovascular disease, those who had a higher consumption of legumes had a reduced chance of developing type 2 diabetes (12).
        <br>
        <br>
        SUMMARY<br>
        Beans are cheap, nutritious, and have a low glycemic index, making them a healthy option for people with diabetes.
        <br>
        <br>
        7. Greek yogurt
        <br>
        <br>
        A long-term study involving health data from more than 100,000 participants found that a daily serving of yogurt was linked to an 18 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (13Trusted Source).

        Studies show yogurt and other dairy foods may lead to weight loss and improved body composition in people with type 2 diabetes (14Trusted Source).
        
        The high levels of calcium, protein, and a special type of fat called conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) found in yogurt may help keep you full for longer.
